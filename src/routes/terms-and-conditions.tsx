The exact services depend on the applicable proposal, quotation, statement of work, or written agreement."],
  ["2. Acceptance of These Terms", "By using this website, submitting an inquiry, requesting a quotation, making a payment, signing a proposal, or engaging Ceasiun, you agree to these Terms. A specific written client agreement may contain additional terms and will generally apply where it conflicts with these website Terms."],
  ["3. Website Use", "You may use the website only for lawful purposes. You must not use it for fraud or abuse, attempt unauthorized access, introduce malware, interfere with availability or security, copy or scrape content without permission, impersonate Ceasiun, or facilitate illegal activity. We may restrict access where reasonably necessary to protect our systems, users, business, or legal rights."],
  ["4. Service Engagements", "A service request does not guarantee acceptance. Scope, deliverables, timelines, pricing, payment schedules, and responsibilities may be defined in a proposal, quotation, contract, statement of work, or invoice. We may decline work outside our capabilities, policies, legal authorization, or reasonable security limits."],
  ["5. Project Scope and Deliverables", "Deliverables are based on the agreed requirements. Additional features, integrations, revisions, pages, content, or functionality outside the approved scope may create additional charges or change the timeline. Changes requested after approval may affect both cost and delivery."],
  ["6. Payments", "Payment terms are communicated before or during a project. Unless agreed otherwise, work may begin after an advance payment, milestone payments may become due on completion or delivery, and final handover may depend on payment of outstanding amounts. Third-party costs, subscriptions, hosting, domains, advertising budgets, APIs, plugins, and licenses may be charged separately. Late payments may delay, suspend, or terminate work."],
  ["7. Revisions and Client Feedback", "Included revisions are defined by the applicable agreement. Clients must provide clear and timely feedback. Repeated changes, major changes after approval, or new requirements may be treated as additional work. Complimentary support does not create a permanent obligation."],
  ["8. Timelines and Delays", "We make reasonable efforts to meet agreed timelines. Delivery depends on timely information, content, assets, credentials, approvals, feedback, payments, and third-party access from the client. We are not responsible for delays caused by providers, platforms, infrastructure, or circumstances outside our reasonable control."],
  ["9. Client Responsibilities", "Clients are responsible for the accuracy and lawful use of all information, content, credentials, trademarks, images, documents, and other assets supplied to Ceasiun. Clients must have the necessary rights and must review and approve final deliverables where approval is requested."],
  ["10. Third-Party Services and Platforms", "Projects may depend on hosting, domains, cloud platforms, Google, Meta, social platforms, payment providers, email, AI APIs, analytics, plugins, themes, libraries, and other providers. These providers control their pricing, policies, functionality, availability, APIs, and security requirements. Third-party fees remain the client's responsibility unless agreed otherwise."],
  ["11. Website Development and Maintenance", "Development, deployment, maintenance, optimization, integrations, and support are provided only as included in the agreed scope. Hosting, domain renewal, premium plugins, paid themes, APIs, backups, security monitoring, and future development are separate unless expressly included."],
  ["12. Social Media and Digital Marketing", "We use reasonable professional efforts for social media, advertising, SEO, lead generation, and marketing services, but do not guarantee specific leads, followers, sales, revenue, rankings, advertising results, engagement, or platform approval. Advertising spend is separate from service fees unless stated otherwise."],
  ["13. AI Automation and AI Services", "AI outputs may contain errors, omissions, unexpected results, or inaccurate information. Clients must review important outputs before relying on them for consequential business, financial, legal, operational, or customer decisions. AI services may depend on third-party models, APIs, usage limits, pricing, and availability."],
  ["14. Cyber Security Services", "Security testing and related work are limited to the scope and authorized environments defined in the agreement. Security services reduce or identify certain risks but cannot guarantee complete security, immunity from attacks, or prevention of data loss. Testing must be authorized by the client."],
  ["15. Intellectual Property", "Unless agreed otherwise, Ceasiun retains pre-existing materials, frameworks, reusable components, processes, templates, tools, systems, and know-how. Ownership and usage rights for client-specific deliverables depend on the applicable agreement and payment status. Clients are responsible for rights to third-party materials."],
  ["16. Portfolio and Marketing Use", "Unless restricted in writing, Ceasiun may display completed work, screenshots, logos, and non-confidential project information in its portfolio, website, social media, case studies, and marketing materials. Confidential information will not intentionally be disclosed."],
  ["17. Confidentiality", "Each party should take reasonable measures to protect confidential information received during a project and should not intentionally disclose it to unauthorized parties, except where required by law or necessary to perform agreed services. Separate confidentiality agreements may apply."],
  ["18. Data and Personal Information", "Information is handled as described in our Privacy Policy. Clients are responsible for ensuring information supplied to Ceasiun or processed on their behalf is collected and used lawfully. Additional data, technical, or security requirements may be agreed for specific projects."],
  ["19. Refunds and Cancellations", "Refund eligibility depends on the service, completed work, third-party expenses, and applicable agreement. Completed work, consumed services, licenses, external costs, and delivered work may not be refundable unless agreed or required by law. Cancellation after work starts may require payment for completed work and costs incurred."],
  ["20. Monthly and Recurring Services", "Recurring service terms may define periods, deliverables, limits, reporting, payment, renewal, and cancellation. Unused services, credits, revisions, or hours do not automatically carry forward. Missed payments may suspend or terminate services."],
  ["21. No Guarantee of Business Results", "Unless expressly guaranteed in writing, Ceasiun does not guarantee revenue, profit, traffic, rankings, leads, sales, followers, conversions, security outcomes, or business performance. Results depend on factors outside our control, including products, pricing, market, competition, operations, budget, audience, and platforms."],
  ["22. Disclaimer of Warranties", "To the extent permitted by law, the website and general information are provided on an as-available and as-is basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, complete or current information, error-free functionality, third-party compatibility, absence of vulnerabilities, or particular service results."],
  ["23. Limitation of Liability", "To the maximum extent permitted by law, Ceasiun will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, revenue, opportunities, data, goodwill, or anticipated savings. Any non-excludable liability is limited to the extent permitted by law."],
  ["24. Indemnification", "To the extent permitted by law, clients may be responsible for claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses arising from client-supplied materials, unauthorized intellectual property, unlawful use, third-party rights violations, misuse, or harmful instructions."],
  ["25. Suspension and Termination", "Ceasiun may suspend or terminate access or services for non-payment, material breach, misuse, security risks, fraud, unlawful activity, abuse, client inactivity that prevents completion, or legal requirements. Termination does not remove payment obligations that arose before termination."],
  ["26. Force Majeure", "Ceasiun is not responsible for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control, including infrastructure failures, natural disasters, war, government action, widespread cyber incidents, provider outages, labor disruptions, or events that could not reasonably be prevented."],
  ["27. Changes to These Terms", "We may update these Terms to reflect changes to services, operations, website, or legal requirements. Updated Terms will be published on this page with a revised date. Continued use may constitute acceptance to the extent permitted by law."],
  ["28. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution", "These Terms are governed by laws applicable to Ceasiun and the relevant client relationship, subject to mandatory legal rights. Disputes should first be addressed through good-faith communication. Formal disputes may use courts, arbitration, mediation, or another mechanism required by law or the applicable agreement. Jurisdiction: to be confirmed after legal review."],
  ["29. Severability", "If any provision is invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue to apply to the extent permitted by law."],
  ["30.
